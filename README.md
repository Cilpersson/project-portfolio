# What is this

I've lost count on which project during the Technigo bootcamp this is. Assignment: **Build your portfolio**.

## How I started

I pretty much started from the top, meaning the header, and continued my way down on the design. I did mobile first and then tablet and desktop. The tablet and desktop designs have a few minor differences but mostly look the same.

### What I struggled with and should improve for next weeks project

I think I could have done a better job with the structure of my HTML. With that I mean that with the help of better planning I could have "recycled" a lot of containers and that would also have made the CSS a bit shorter as well.

### What I'm proud of

I'm proud of how far I've come. The first project compared to this is like night and day.

I had som issues with the video in the header, because when I used overflow: hidden a small part of my profile image was hidden as well. But I managed to fix it and that makes me really proud!

I'm also proud that I changed colours on the SVG-files. Both the tiny icon in the tab and the larger ones.

## If I had more time

If I had more time I would deep dive into ARIA, but since we are starting with react I want to spend as much time as possible on that.
